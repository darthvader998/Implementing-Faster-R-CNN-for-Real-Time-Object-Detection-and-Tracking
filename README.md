# Implementing-Faster-R-CNN-for-Real-Time-Object-Detection-and-Tracking
 The notebook focuses on implementing the Faster R-CNN model for object detection, optimized for real-time applications while maintaining a balance between speed and accuracy. It details the selection, implementation, and evaluation of Faster R-CNN compared to other models like YOLO and SSD, particularly in handling the COCO 2017 dataset.
